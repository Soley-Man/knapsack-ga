# knapsack-ga
This project serves as an introduction to genetic algorithms in Python. I will build a genetic algorithm using PyGAD to solve the 0/1 Knapsack problem with various constraints.

Every item in the problem has a value, weight, and volume. An item's value can range from 1$ to 5$, its weight from 1kg to 7kg, and its volume from 1L to 6L, all with incremental steps of 1 unit. The knapsack can only carry 16kg and has a capacity of 13L.

The items' data is stored in knapsack_items.csv.
